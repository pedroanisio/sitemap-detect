# Sitemap Detector API

The Sitemap Detector API is a Python Flask application designed to detect sitemap URLs from a given website URL using multiple detection strategies. This API can be particularly useful for SEO purposes, allowing users to quickly find sitemap files referenced in either the robots.txt file or embedded within HTML pages.

## Features

- Detection of sitemap URLs from `robots.txt`.
- Detection of commonly named sitemap XML files.
- Detection of sitemap URLs embedded in HTML via `<link>` tags.

## Requirements

Ensure that you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You can install all necessary Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/pedroanisio/sitemap-detect.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
